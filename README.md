# hello-world
======================

Hi there!

I am a fan of country music and crossword puzzles. I say I love living in places with four seasons, but really I just look forward to getting in a canoe and playing rummy on a picnic table when summer rolls around.

I recently sold a trivia game to NPR's Ask Me Another, so I'm looking forward to learning to code to fund my career as a freelance puzzle writer/word nerd.
